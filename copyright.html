    <h1 style="text-align: center; padding-top: 30px;">Fake Drug Detection to combat Counterfiet drugs</h1>
    <p style="text-align: center; font-size:20px;"><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>      
    <p style="text-align: justify; font-size:18px; margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%;">Counterfeit and falsified drugs can have a serious impact upon human health. In 2017, WHO analyzed drug samples and found that 10.5 percent of pharmaceutical drugs in low and middle-income countries are fake or substandard. The latest report from the European Union Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO) and the organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) highlights the dangers of counterfeit medicines for patients as well as the challenges posed by this form of illicit trade for governments and health care companies. The trend has only been exacerbated by the current health emergency created by COVID-19, with people worried about how to deal with this new unknown danger, which still has no approved vaccine or treatment, and the spread of potentially harmful fake products and medicines. Thus, the need arises to design a blockchain based system which helps in fighting with the falsified medicines and ensuring the security of e-health records. In the proposed system the data integrity is ensured through the posed block-chain technology and authentication is assured by the Keyless Signature Infrastructure which ensures the privacy of digital signature. The advance features of Blockchain makes it capable of giving a basis for complete traceability of medicines from manufacturer to end patients, and the ability to detect counterfeit medicines or drugs. It will allow consumers to scan a code printed on the receipt of their purchases to review the drug distribution history. We are developing a Distributed Application (DApp) that will run on smart contracts, employing Swarm as the Distributed File System (DFS). Two instances will be developed: one for Ethereum and another for Hyperledger Fabric. The proof-of-work (PoW) consensus algorithm of Ethereum will be modified into a delegated proof-of-stake (DPoS) or practical Byzantine fault tolerance (PBFT) consensus algorithm as it is scalable and fits the drug supply chain environment. The system will adopt the GS1 pedigree standard and will satisfy the data points in the data standardization guidelines from the US FDA. Simulations will use the following 5 nodes: for FDA, manufacturer, wholesaler, retailer, and the consumer portal.</p>
