    <p style="text-align: center; font-size:20px;"><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>      
    <p style="text-align: justify; font-size:18px; margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%;">Online Auction management system is a web-based application that will assist
        clients with buying or selling items; they can sell anything they want by posting
        advertisements. This application will enable clients to post their items for auction;
        bidders can create an account and can bid for any available product. Some current
        applications offer clients to bid on products but these arenâ€™t available in the local
        area. Which is a disadvantage because you are unable to look at the product before
        you buy. With this Online Auction application, clients will be able to bid for
        products that are available in their local area.</p>
