    <p style="text-align: center; font-size:20px;"><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>      
    <p style="text-align: justify; font-size:18px; margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%;">Drone addiction and use is constantly increasing in many areas. This is due to the 
        drone's ability to provide live streams, real-time video and image recording, and the ability to 
        skip and transport goods. As a result, more than 10,000 drones will be commercially available 
        over the next five years. This is primarily due to its higher cost and budget than commercial 
        helicopters. In addition, technological advances have made it possible to fly mini drones with 
        a simple operation via a smartphone instead of using a remote control. In fact, the use of drones 
        is not limited to commercial or personal purposes. Drones are used by law enforcement 
        agencies and border control oversight teams. It is used by search and rescue teams to collect 
        information and store important supplies in the event of a natural disaster. However, drones are 
        not only used by "good people." The "bad guys" use drones to achieve malicious goals. Drones 
        are easy to control and can be used for a variety of attacks. Drones, on the other hand, reveal 
        security loopholes that make them vulnerable to hijacking. This paper outlines drone attacks / 
        attacks on drones and their countermeasures. Drone reliance and use is increasing in a variety of fields. This is due to the drones' 
        ability to live-stream, capture real-time video and images, and fly and transport goods. As a 
        result, thousands of drones will be operational in the next five years. As in every field, drones 
        are used in detecting and analysing anti-terrorist activities i.e., to spy on the terrorists. Drones 
        provide more advanced surveillance, and the usage of artificial intelligence makes the risk 
        identification and decision making more effective and instantaneous. Drones are now used for 
        advanced observations and covert operations because of their quick access as well as their 
        precise targeting capability. Using a pre-trained machine learning model, the drone finds, 
        tracks, and follows another drone within its sensor range and hunts it with a laser beam. 
        Mounting the lasers on drones lets the authorities quickly move them close to the action and 
        respond.
        High-tech devices have been developed to assist them in dealing with a variety of 
        situations that may arise during their mission. The location of an army person can be 
        determined with the help of a drone. Chips implanted in the bodies of soldiers will aid in the 
        differentiation of army person from terrorists, and this information will be used to launch a 
        laser attack on the terrorists.</p>
